HTML

- what are the contents of a web page?
- what elements make up your page?

CSS

- what do those elements look like?

HTML and CSS are not programming languages!

HTML = HyperText Markup Language
- content of a page, data about a page, and elements that make up a web page
- elements include text, images, tables, video, links, lists, and other resources
- data about the elements too

HTML creates types of elements - a paragraph, image, list, etc.
HTML defines what the content of an element is - text, image, video, etc.
HTML elements can be nested - a paragraph can contain a list, a list can contain list items, etc.


Example HTML Element = <h1>Hello, HTML Tags!</h1>

Tag name - h1
Contents - the text (Hello, HTML Tags!)
Open tag - <h1>
Close tag - </h1>

<!DOCTYPE html> - specifies page is HTML5

<head> .... </head> - contains info about the page - only title is visible

<body> ... </body> - visible page content


HTML tags are NOT case sensitive
Indentation does NOT matter - usually whitespace is ignored
If a new line is needed, use <p> (paragraph) or <br> (line break)
Can write HTML elements over multiple lines
Incorrect HTML will either be ignored or browser will try to correct it (won't crash, but might display weird)

HTML Elements

Start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag
Can nest tags in other tags
Tags need to be completely contained in their parent tag
Each open tg needs a matching closing tag

Paragraphs - enclose text in <p> ... </p>
Line breaks - single <br> tag
<b> ... </b> - makes text bold
<i> ... </i> - makes text italicized
<u> ... </u> - makes text underlined

h1 through h6 tags create different level headings in a page
h1 - header text
h2- sub header
h3 - sub sub header
h4 - sub sub sub header
and so on...

Two types of lists:
- <ol> ordered/numbered
- <ul> unordered/bullet points

Nest <li> inside of <ol> or <ul> to create each list element

<a> tag - links
Specify the link target with href attribute
Can specify the URL as a relative link, for another page on your own site
Or full URL (including HTTP or HTTPS) to an external site
Text inside <a> ... </a> will be link text

HTML elements can have attributes
- Specifying the URL for a link - href in <a> elements
- Specifying the source of an image file or image element, or alt-text
- Adding a unique id to uniquely identify one element on a page
- Giving many elements the same class - to identify elements that are treated similarly
- Many others

Images are created with an img tag that has 3 attributes:
- src attribute for the image file (required)
- alt attribute for alt-text (for screen-readers/text that is displayed if image is not found.
Optional but recommended)
- title attribute that is displayed as a tool-tip when the image is hovered over (optional)

src can be absolute or relative
Can also specify the height and/or width attributes

Tables
<table> tag makes a table
<tr> for a table row
<th> for header rows
<td> for table data elements

Bold text for headers is applied by browser as a default style,
but can override with CSS
