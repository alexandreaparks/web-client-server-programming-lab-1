    <h2><b>Alexandrea's 3 Cats!</b></h2>

    <p>This is Stella! I rescued her from behind a dumpster
    at a Kwik Trip in Wisconsin.</p>

    <p>This is Riley! When I moved to Minneapolis, I rescued another cat from someone's backyard.
    I was told by multiple people that the cat was a boy, including a veterinarian.
    Turns out they were very wrong, Riley is a girl AND she was pregnant. I didn't find this
    out until I came home to 3 newborn kittens in my living room.
    </p>

    <p>The next picture is Riley's 3 baby kittens. From left to right,
     their names are Leo, August Pepper, and Benny.
    All of them are still in the family. I kept August Pepper, my sister
    kept Leo, and my Aunt Mel has Benny.</p>

    <p>The final picture is the baby I kept, August Pepper. She's a little over 2 years old, and
    sassier than ever.</p>
