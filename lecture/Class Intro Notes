Technologies used in Web Apps

- HTML for content
- CSS for style
- Front end JavaScript fot interactivity
- HTTP and the client/server model
- Server application logic
- Databases
- Hosting aka where does the server code run?


Front End (client-side) Technologies

Front end = client side
Client = browser
Front end is things that are run by a browser

HTML - describes content of a page
CSS - applies styles, colors, layout to a page
JavaScript - interactivity on a page

Vue.js is a JavaScript front end framework - more application logic in the browser

Angular and React are two very popular front end JS frameworks, but they are too
large and complex for this class

Vue.js is probably 3rd most popular - once understood, easier to learn React or Angular


Server Code - Java, Python, C#, Ruby PHP

Using Node.js - JavaScript, for servers
Express.js - web application framework - simplifies common web app tasks
Node.js is getting more popular and are good for small to medium sites


Databases - using PostgreSQL as a cloud service - very similar to other relational databases


Web development requires breadth of knowledge - lots of technologies and topics to cover to build a web app!
